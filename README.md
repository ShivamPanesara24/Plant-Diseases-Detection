# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Website

This project is a web-based application for detecting plant diseases using machine learning models. It includes a **frontend** built with **HTML**, **CSS (Bootstrap 5)**, **JavaScript**, and **animations**, and a **backend** developed using **Python**. The machine learning model is trained and tested using a dataset from **Kaggle**.

Users can also **retrain** or **extend** the model with new diseases using the provided training scripts!

## 🚀 Features

- Detect plant diseases from uploaded leaf images.
- Animated, responsive frontend using **Bootstrap 5** and custom animations.
- Machine Learning model built with **TensorFlow**/**Keras**.
- Training and testing code provided for retraining or expanding the model.
- Easy integration of new plant diseases into the dataset and model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, CSS3
- **Backend:** Python 3 (Flask/Django as server framework)
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas
- **Dataset:** [Plant Village Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection


### 2. Install Python Requirements

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Run the Backend Server

python app.py
The server will start at:
